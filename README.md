### HashDit Smart Contract Security API 

1. Introduction

Hashditâ€™s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday Defi investors to make informed decisions.  Defi investing can be highly profitable and full of pitfalls at the same time.  Navigating this landscape is difficult for an experienced investor, let alone a newbie.  At Hashdit we want to bridge this divide by providing timely and comprehensive threat intel about Defi projects.  We use a variety of automated and manual techniques to evaluate a Defi project.  We give you our findings without bias, letting you make a decision based on facts.
