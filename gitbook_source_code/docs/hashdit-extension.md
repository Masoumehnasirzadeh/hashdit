## Type of Risks Detected by HashDit Extension
| Scam Type      | 	Example |	Coverage |
| ----------- | 	----------- |	----------- |
|Wallet Drainers|	Sophisticated scam groups which use different measures such as tricking users to ‘approve’ their funds to the scammers, resulting in their NFTs, tokens, or other assets being stolen.|	Y|
|Malicious signatures|	Misleading functions with ill-intent, such as 'Set Approval For All', 'eth_sign', etc which can lead to users losing their assets.|	Y|
|Low trust domains|	Websites with very low reputation, often linked to spam, malware, social engineering phishing, and scams. They usually impersonate notable online platforms.|	Y|
|High risk contract method calls|	Risky method calls such as 'SecurityUpdate()', which are designed to deceive users into sending ETH to the scam contract.|	Y|
|Honeypot detection & other smart contract risks|	Honeypot token is one example which only allows users to trade into an asset without being able to sell it afterwards. Other risks include but are not limited to: backdoor, scam tokens and centralization risks.|	Y|
|Rug pulls|	Sudden abandonment of a project by the scam creator(s), after the team initially promises to work and develop on the project. This usually occurs once the investment amount by the victims is deemed enough by the scam creators.|	Y|
|Address poisoning|	The attacker creates a vanity address that is very similar to the victim's address. They then send very small amounts of cryptocurrency to the victim's address, hoping when victims see a transaction for a token they typically interact with in their transaction history, victims might copy the recipient address (thinking it is their own) and then send funds to that address.|	Y|
|Seed phrase compromise|	Scams to steal the users’ seed phrases/private keys, thereby being able to control their crypto assets.|	Coming soon|
