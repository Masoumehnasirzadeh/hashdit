### Key themes on high risks:

1. Roughly 34% of the newly identified risky addresses were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs. 

2. Another theme for these contracts is that they showed **scam** features. This means that it could be a Ponzi, Honeypot or fake token. This portion represents 26% of the total newly identified risky addresses.

3. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a **privileged** role, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some **centralization** risk as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 21% of the total newly identified risky addresses. 

Refer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/11092023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.

Tip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.

## Integrations with PancakeSwap
Hashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBayâ€™s Red Alarm. The risk score level reflects how risky the interacted token is, helping users make better informed decisions.


Example: Fake Circle Token - 0x84ef2e2e977062da3cfc12c038fa3ce2d42d01b1

Please take note that the risk level in Pancake & Risk Scanner might be different, because [Hashdit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) use more conservative strategies for PancakeSwap than [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/) risk scanner.
