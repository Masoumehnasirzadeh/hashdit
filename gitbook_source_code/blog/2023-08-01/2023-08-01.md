## Overview

<div align="justify">

This report focuses on security events that happened on BSC in 2023 H1, analyzing the type of projects targeted and sharing the common attack techniques used in 2023 H1, with respect to the financial loss of the incidents.

#### Disclaimer

The financial data provided here is accurate based on our own monitoring system and based on the $USD amount of the cryptocurrency involved at the time of the incident. Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.

Furthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true “exploited amount” of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.


#### BSC Innovations
2023 H1 has been an exciting first half for BSC as the BNB Chain team has been continually innovating and building new technologies.

Just to name a few, in H1:

- The [Greenfield Testnet](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/en) went Live: The Greenfield testnet, is an open-source project aimed at providing a scalable and efficient data availability layer for decentralized applications (dApps).

![IMG-1](./gnfd.jpeg)

- [Reduced Transaction Costs](https://forum.bnbchain.org/t/a-proposal-for-adopting-a-lower-transaction-fee-cost-on-bnb-smart-chain-to-enhance-competitiveness/): Following extensive discussions, BSC validators have lowered transaction costs from **5 Gwei to 3 Gwei**. This reduction in fees will help drive network adoption, making BNB Chain an even more attractive platform for developers and users. 

- [BSC Validators Self-Stake Update](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/BSC-FAQs-validator): Thanks to an on-chain governance proposal, validators significantly reduced the cost to become a BNB Smart Chain validator, fostering a more diverse and robust ecosystem. This change greatly benefits the community by improving entry cost to be a BSC validator. Self-Staked moved from **10,000 BNB** to **2,000 BNB**.

- BNB Chain exhibited a significant rise in market share, demonstrating steady growth in the percentage of verified smart contracts. Its market share increased from **38%** at the beginning of Q2 to **45%** by the end of H1. This performance underscores BNB Chain's dominance and the high level of trust placed in its infrastructure by developers and users.

- [OpBNB](https://opbnb.bnbchain.org/en) and [ZkBNB](https://zkbnb.bnbchain.org/): Two significant upcoming projects are the OpBNB testnet and the ZkBNB testnet, were launched. These projects will further enhance the capabilities of the BNB Chain ecosystem, offering developers even more opportunities to innovate.

## 2023 H1 in focus

### General

In total, nearly $101.84 million were lost to security incidents on BSC. By observing the monthly chart below, the months with the top amount loss were May, March followed by June. 

![IMG-5](./Month_overview.png)

<p align="center">

This chart shows the number of projects impacted by exploits in 2023 H1.

![IMG-6](./Month_Incidents.png)

<p align="center">
Figure 3: Number of different project impacted by exploits
</p>

In total, there were 199 incidents on BSC.

As seen in Figure 3, the highest number of security incidents took place in June.


### Comparison with H1 previous years

When we compare the data with H1 of previous years, there is a decreasing trend, which can signify that the security posture of BNB Chain has improved over the years.

![IMG-7](./Comparison_with_past_years.png)

<p align="center">

</p>

### Type of attack vectors

Out of the 199 security incidents, hacks take up 66.33%, 33.17% are scams, while 1 particular incident was due to a White-hat hack. The White-hat [hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hashflow-users-made-whole-after-600k-exploit) is related to the Hashflow project, whereby an old contract had an Open Approval, this means that any users that have approved funds to the victim contract, can have his existing funds stolen.

![IMG-8](./Proportion_Exploit_Type.png)

<p align="center">
Figure 5: Proportion of different type of exploits
</p>

However, it is interesting to note that even when the number of hacks are nearly double of hacks, the financial impact of scams are less significant than the ones related to the hacks. The total financial loss of hacks ($35m) is nearly half of the loss to hacks ($66m), as shown below in Figure 6 below.

![IMG-9](./Fiat_Exploit_Type.png)

<p align="center">
Figure 6: Financial impact measured in dollars comparing different types of incidents
</p>

Looking at the comparison with 2022 H1, we see a very interesting point: we see that this trend was actually reversed! In 2022, the number of scam incidents was double that of hack cases, with the financial loss of hacks being double that of scams. Refer to the previous [report](https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/bsc-2022-end-of-year-report/) for more information.

This can suggest that the number of scammers in the crypto space are growing, with ever changing techniques to trick users. And developers of smaller known projects tend to pay less attention to security in general.  

### Specific attack vectors

Figure 7 displays the specific attack vectors against its financial loss in 2023 H1.


![IMG-10](./Type_of_exploits_this_month.png)

<p align="center">
Figure 7: Proportion of the funds lost comparing the different type of vulnerabilities
</p>

Looking at the breakdown, 25% attributes to rugpulls, the 2nd most common attack vector was due to the Reflection Vulnerability. Several token smart contracts deployed on BSC utilize the Reflection mechanism for token holders to gain dividends, however the reflection implementation might be flawed, leading to its liquidity pool being drained by malicious actors. The 3rd most common attack vector was Price Manipulation at 8.15%. This is common as well since poorly designed smart contracts rely on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools, and hence can be easily manipulated by a large Swap trade or Flash Loan by hackers.

### Type of projects

When focusing on the project type vs financial loss, a whopping 98.77% of financial loss are attributed to DeFi projects. 

The 2nd most project type targeted was Bridge projects at 0.56%, followed by GameFi and Metaverse projects at 0.27% and 0.20% respectively. 

![IMG-11](./Project_type.png)

<p align="center">
Figure 8: Proportion of funds lost comparing the type of project 
</p>

With a large proportion of fiat loss associated with DeFi projects, this can suggest that DeFi projects are still the most common type of Crypto project in the space. At the same time, it shows how important it is for users to only invest in reputable and well audited projects, to stay clear of potential rugpulls and vulnerabilities.

### Top 10 incidents in 2023 H1

The following were the top 10 security incidents in terms of financial loss in 2023 H1.

</p>

#### Fintoch - $31.6 Million Loss

On 25-May-2023, Fintoch, a Ponzi platform was reported to have rugpulled for $31.6 million USD. The funds were since bridged to multiple addresses on Tron and Ethereum. Its users reported that they could not withdraw funds. 

Fintoch advertises to be a blockchain financial platform built by Morgan Stanley, and users can get 1% return on investment every day. The team page on the Fintoch website refers to "Bobby Lambert'' as its CEO, when in fact he doesn't exist and is a paid actor. Earlier, the Singapore government and Morgan Stanley both [issued](https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/global-offices/pdf/Indonesia/Indonesia_Fintoch_Important_Notice.pdf) warnings about the investment plan.

#### ippswap - $14.5 Million Loss

On 26-May-2023, a Scam project, ippswap was found to have conducted a rugpull for $14.5 million USD. ippswap The project party called the privileged backdoor method takeToken() of the staking contract to transfer out IPPSwap LP Tokens, staked by users, to himself. He then subsequently removed liquidity using the above LP tokens to gain $14,535,741.86 USDT

Some of the USDT funds flowed to Binance CEX where the funds have been frozen by the Binance team.


#### Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss

The Safemoon project was exploited for $8.9 million USD on 29-Mar-2023. The Safemoon liquidity pool was compromised after a code upgrade introduced a bug, a public burn() function. The hacker was able to burn the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool, artificially inflating the price of the SFM tokens, and then sold sufficient tokens to wipe out all the WBNB in the pool.

On April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, that is, transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, leaving the remaining 20% as a bounty.

#### SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss

SwapX, a DeFi project, faced an Open Approval issue starting from 27-Feb-2023, resulting in users losing more than $7.3 million USD. Users of BSCex / SwapX, a DEX on BNB Chain, had their funds stolen from their wallets. Vulnerabilities were found in four old contracts (deployed on Jan. 2021, May. 2021, July 2021, and Oct. 2021) belonging to the DEX. Many users still have active approvals to these contracts, even though they haven't used it for a long time. Affected users remain at risk as long as they haven't revoked their approvals.

#### Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss

On 12-June-2023, Atlantis Loans faced a malicious Governance proposal takeover, coupled with the abandonment by the team, resulting in ~$3.5 million USD loss. On April 12, the first indicator was shown as its official TG channel was deleted and a backup channel was created instead, with multiple users of the community claiming that the project had been abandoned and that they are trying to build it up again. A malicious proposal was then submitted to take over the core contracts of Atlantis Loans which was successfully shut down by the new project party.

However, a similar proposal that was submitted on June 12, was not blocked this time, which resulted in the hacker stealing funds from users that have approved to the Atlantis Loans core contracts.  

#### $FUT - $2.7 Million Loss

Early this year, on 4-Jan-2023, $FUT project team conducted a rugpull for $2.7 million USD.  The project party was able to invoke the privileged function withdrawSushiReward() of the Masterchef contract to transfer all the FCS to another controlled wallet. He then subsequently swapped all his FCS for $FUT before exiting for USDT. 
Once again, this shows the risk of over-centralization by the project party, as they have too many privileges and can easily backdoor funds from users.


#### Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss

On 12-Jan-2023, the Circulate Ponzi managed to scam around $2.3 million USD from users. The CirculateBUSD and CirculateWBNB contracts promised users high APR by depositing funds with them. When users deposit funds, they invoke the startTrading() method of the contract, this in turn calls a third party dependency: SwapHelper contract which is unverified. However, upon decompiling the code, we noticed that there was a hardcoded condition that when the contract reached $2m of staked funds, the funds will be immediately transferred to a designated project team’s address.

Even though it is currently unknown how the scammer in this incident was able to get large investment into their recently created contracts (~2 days), it is highly likely that the contracts were scams from the beginning due to design bugs in the SwapHelper contract. 

On the whole, third party dependencies in smart contracts present a security risk. Whilst reliance on third parties such as the use of oracles is sometimes unavoidable, developers should avoid these dependencies as much as possible. 


#### YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss

On 17-Jan-2023, YieldRobot scam managed to scam users of around $2.1 million USD. For context, YieldRobot is a De-Fi protocol which promises to give yield for users that deposit BUSD.

Two days prior to the incident, the YieldRobot contract deployer wallet set the signer to a new EOA (0x3f531). The signer address is needed to approve the redemption of coupons.

In order to redeem a coupon it must pass a check to verify it has the correct signer. Once approved, the coupon is added to the user’s reward balance. In this incident, 0x8f2DB called setCoupon() which credited them 2.1m BUSD.

Essentially, the new signer approved the malicious coupon redemption, as such he was able to claimRewards of the contract’s BUSD balance and drain all the BUSD funds.


#### LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss

On 7-Feb-2023, the LianGo protocol was exploited for $1.6 million USD, roughly 6,148,859 LGT reward coins were stolen. For context, LianGo is a decentralized payment consumption and LGT is their main token.

The reason for the theft was that the owner administrator of LGTPool created a fake LP token pledge pool (pool 3), and then the thief put a large amount of LP tokens into the pool, pledged and obtained 6.14 million LGT reward tokens. 

Based on on-chain data, the thief has been preparing for the theft for a long time. 58 days before the incident, the stealer’s address obtained the gas fee from Tornado Cash, and deployed the fake LP contract 32 days before the incident.

Then on the same day the LianGoPay project deployed the trading pair contracts of LGT tokens and WBNB on Pancake. This contract address is very similar to the address of the fake LP contract that was deployed earlier -- the 4 letters before and after are the same, which can be easily confused. As such, it is likely a private key compromise to the project’s back end system.

The administrator of the LGTPool contract initiated three consecutive transactions to create pledge pools, the first two of which also created a real one when creating two fake LP token pledge pools (pools 3 and 4). LP token pool for WBNB and LGT. Because the front and rear four digits of the real and fake LP token contract addresses are the same, it is difficult for users to detect that the first two created LP pools are fake LP pools. 

Then the attacker launched an attack, first deploying an attack contract. When the contract was initialized, a huge amount of fake LP tokens was pledged for the fake No. 3 LP pledge pool - up to 614885935211982505426257800000000.

Then the attacker initiated a redemption transaction and received the rewarded LGT tokens. Because of the huge amount of pledged principal, 6.14 million LGT rewards were generated. These reward tokens were exchanged for 1.62 million BSC-USD tokens and transferred to an address starting with 0xCb65 (this address used to receive gas fees from Tornado Cash 58 days before the incident).


#### DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss

On 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $1.3 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on 3 different chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum and on the BNB Chain. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.

The issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.


## Conclusion

BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and verified contracts. However, it is undeniable that 2023 H1 has proven to be a tough year for both investors and developers due to the continued bear market trend and exploit incidents. Below we have some final advice for investors and developers:

For investors:

- Understand what you're signing, don't blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)
- Always double check that you are on the official website of the DApp
- Be extra wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team’s authenticity
- Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)
- Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done
- Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)
  If _High Risk_ is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away

**Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!**

For developers:

- Verify & open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)
- Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)
- Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure
- Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases
- Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations
- Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary
- Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)
- Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)
- Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token
